# Weathrly
This was my first real interaction with ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, pulling data from an API, and managing the state of my application. This is usually a paired project but I decided to do this by myself and ended up really digging into React and learning to enjoy testing.

## Project Specifications

  * App
    * Should do all of the heavy lifting for the entire application
    * Should handle state
  * Welcome
    * Base start screen if local storage doesn't have past user searches saved
  * Search
    * Should allow the user to search based off of city/state OR zipcode
    * Last searched location should persist after refresh
  * Current Weather
